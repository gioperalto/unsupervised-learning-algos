# Unsupervised Learning Assignment - Giovanni Peralto
Code was written in Python 3.x. Python/pip is needed to run the program.

### Instructions:

Install dependencies: 
- `pip install matplotlib`
- `pip install numpy`
- `pip install scikit-learn`
- `pip install pandas`
- `pip install time`
- `pip install sys`
- `pip install tqdm`

Create images directories:
- `mkdir images`
- `mkdir images/clustering`
- `mkdir images/clustering/em`
- `mkdir images/clustering/k-means`
- `mkdir images/dimen-reduction`
- `mkdir images/dimen-reduction/ica`
- `mkdir images/dimen-reduction/isomap`
- `mkdir images/dimen-reduction/pca`
- `mkdir images/dimen-reduction/rp`
- `mkdir images/nn`

Run instructions (examples):
- k-means: `python k-means.py fish_market`
- ICA: `python ica.py red_wine_quality km`
- KNN: `python knn.py`
- NN: `python nn.py`

Clustering algorithm and Dimensionality Reduction algorithm python files have instructions in case they are incorrectly run.
